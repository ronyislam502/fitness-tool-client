          <p>
            Fitness Tolls was founded in 2024 with the aim of revolutionizing
            the fitness equipment industry. Recognizing the growing demand for
            high-quality, affordable fitness products, our founders set out to
            create a brand that would meet the needs of fitness enthusiasts of
            all levels. From humble beginnings as a small startup, Fitness Tolls
            has grown into a leading e-commerce platform, serving thousands of
            customers across Bangladesh.
